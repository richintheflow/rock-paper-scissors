# The Odin Project Web Development 101
## Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

This is my first **HTML/CSS/JS** project. 
<!-- Live version of the game is here. -->
### First stage | Game in the browser console

__The benefits I got from this stage:__

* Learned how to read and understand the errors on the console() and fix them.
* Created an algorithm and made it work.

If want to enjoy the game click here [--LINK--](https://richintheflow.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) and follow the next instructions:
* Press F12 to open the DevTools of your browser and click "Console" on the top of the DevTools panel.
* Type on the prompt rock, paper or scissors
* See the result on the DevTools console of your browser.

<!-- Second stage | Game with added UI -->

<!-- The benefits I got from this stage: -->

<!--     Learned to use and modify Font Awesome Icons. -->
<!--     Deepened knowledge of CSS transform and transition effects. -->
<!--     Installed and learned to use ESlint for code problems fixing. -->
<!--     Learned basic manipulations of elements styles through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts). -->
<!--     Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions (organization, workspaces, scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones..). -->

<!-- Summary -->

<!--     For a more playful experience, theme was changed to 'Fantasy' and name was changed to 'Wand Bow Mace'. -->
<!--     The game has a responsive layout with one breakpoint. -->
<!--     The game is fully playable in the browser window. -->
<!--     I really tried to keep readable and understandable code, short functions, descriptive names and fantasy mood of the game.sparkles -->
